  <!--In creating the Keywords, I rephrased some of the keywords and put some longer keywords to expand the audience that can see my work. I also made one of my keywords specific to increase the chance of my page showing up for my audience who are more likely to use that specific keyword than other people.-->

    <p><i>&quot;The future belongs to those who prepare for it today.&quot;</i></p><!--I used the <i> semantic tag for the slogan, because it makes the text italic, but does not emphasize like the <em> tag which was used two highlight the two lines I found the most profound in the poem. The reason why it would have been better to use the <i> tag for the slogan is because is allows the quote to look unique, but does not put too much importance on it,so the reader focuses on the rest of the content. However, with the lines from the poem, we want to make them stand out from the rest of the poem, so we use the <em> tag instead so that the reader can also think about the lines..-->

   <h2>Any Human to Another</h2>
    <p>Countee Cullen</p>
    <p>The ills I sorrow at<br>
        Not me alone<br>
        Like an arrow,<br>
        Pierce to the marrow,<br>
        Through the fat<br>
        And past the bone.
    </p>
    <p>        
        <em>Your grief and mine<br>
        Must intertwine<br></em><!--The reason I found these two lines important is because these two lines sum up the entire theme of the poem.-->
        Like sea and river,<br>
        Be fused and mingle,<br>
        Diverse yet single,<br>
        Forever and forever.
    </p>
    <p>
        Let no man be so proud<br>
        And confident,<br>
        To think he is allowed<br>
        A little tent<br>
        Pitched in a meadow<br>
        Of sun and shadow<br>
        All his little own.
    </p>
    <p>        
        Joy may be shy, unique,<br>
        Friendly to a few,<br>
        Sorrow may be scorned to speak<br>
        To any who<br>
        Were false or true.<br>

    </p>
    <p>Your every grief<br>
        Like a blade<br>
        Shining and unsheathed
        Must strike me down.<br>
        Of bitter aloes wreathed,<br>
        My sorrow must be laid<br>
        On your head like a crown.
